# healthcare-analysis

This project explores a large-scale health survey dataset provided by the CDC via the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for the year 2015. The primary goal of the notebook is to examine and analyze various health, lifestyle, and demographic factors that could be linked to heart disease or heart attack.

The dataset contains 253,680 patient records and 22 health-related attributes, making it a rich resource for both statistical exploration and predictive modeling.

📌 Objective
To understand what health indicators are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.

To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a public health dataset.

To prepare the dataset for potential machine learning modeling (classification).

To visualize trends and relationships between features using Python libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib.
